# NLP and LLM Projects Repository
This repository contains notebooks and resources focused on fine-tuning and utilizing large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The projects here demonstrate how to apply advanced techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient fine-tuning, as well as how to implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows for question generation and answering.

# Notebooks
1. Fine-Tune Gemma Models in Keras using LoRA
Description:
This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune Gemma models in Keras using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that reduces the computational cost and memory requirements of training large models.

Key Features:

Fine-tuning large language models with minimal resources.
Use of LoRA for low-rank updates.
Customizable pipeline for adapting Gemma models to new tasks.
Technologies:

Keras
LoRA
TensorFlow
2. Question Generation & Answering from PDF (RAG & LoRA)
Description:
This notebook focuses on implementing a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline for question generation and answering from PDFs. By combining RAG with LoRA fine-tuning, it enables efficient handling of document-based question-answering tasks.
Key Features:
Parsing and extracting content from PDFs.
Question generation using LLMs.
Retrieval-based answering using relevant document sections.
Integration of LoRA for optimized model performance.
Technologies:
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
PyPDF2 (or any PDF parsing library)
LoRA
